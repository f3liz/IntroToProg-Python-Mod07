# Pickling and Error Handling
## Introduction
This week’s module we had to research pickle and structured error handling. We also had to demonstrate it in our script. My script this week was simple, using pickle and error handling in the same script it will pickle a user's favorite number and unpickle back out to the user. It will also catch errors, for example if a user didn’t use a numeric value.

## Pickling
From what I have researched on my own, pickling in python is serializing and de-serializing python object structures. Even after reading articles and watching a few videos, I still didn’t completely understand it so I just messed around with the pickle in python. I have come to understand that I can use it to store and retrieve data with fewer lines of code.

## Error Handling
In the video for this week’s module, Randal had gone over structured exception handling (try - except), exception class, catching specific exceptions, and creating custom exception classes. I had used try - except blocks before in previous assignments and labs from this course so I felt comfortable with that. The catching specific exceptions part of the lecture was interesting to me because it was almost like trying to predict any errors that could pop up and getting ahead of those before it could happen. That is something I already try to do in my assignments because I try to think of things that could go wrong for the user and prevent it from happening while trying to make it a little more user friendly.

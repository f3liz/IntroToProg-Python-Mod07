# Pickling and Error Handling
## Introduction
This week’s module we had to research pickle and structured error handling. We also had to demonstrate it in our script. My script this week was simple, using pickle and error handling in the same script it will pickle a user's favorite number and unpickle back out to the user. It will also catch errors, for example if a user didn’t use a numeric value.

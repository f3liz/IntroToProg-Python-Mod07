# Pickling and Error Handling
## Introduction
This week’s module we had to research pickle and structured error handling. We also had to demonstrate it in our script. My script this week was simple, using pickle and error handling in the same script it will pickle a user's favorite number and unpickle back out to the user. It will also catch errors, for example if a user didn’t use a numeric value.

## Pickling
From what I have researched on my own, pickling in python is serializing and de-serializing python object structures. Even after reading articles and watching a few videos, I still didn’t completely understand it so I just messed around with the pickle in python. I have come to understand that I can use it to store and retrieve data with fewer lines of code.
